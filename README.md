# Matrix Calculus for Machine Learning and Beyond

This is the course page for an 18.S096 Special Subject in Mathematics at MIT taught in **January 2024** ([IAP](https://elo.mit.edu/iap/)) by
Professors [Alan Edelman](https://math.mit.edu/~edelman/) and [Steven G. Johnson](https://math.mit.edu/~stevenj/).

**Lectures:** MWF time TBD, Jan 8–Jan 26 in room TBD (+ video recording and posted notes).  3 units, *2 problem sets* due Jan 17 and Jan 24 — submitted electronically via Canvas, no exams.  TA/grader: TBA.

**Piazza forum:** TBA

**Description:**

> We all know that calculus courses such as 18.01 and 18.02 are univariate and vector calculus, respectively. Modern applications such as machine learning and large-scale optimization require the next big step, "matrix calculus" and calculus on arbitrary vector spaces.
>
> This class covers a coherent approach to matrix calculus showing techniques that allow you to think of a matrix holistically (not just as an array of scalars), generalize and compute derivatives of important matrix factorizations and many other complicated-looking operations, and understand how differentiation formulas must be re-imagined in large-scale computing. We will discuss reverse/adjoint/backpropagation differentiation, custom vector-Jacobian products, and how modern automatic differentiation is more computer science than calculus (it is neither symbolic formulas nor finite differences).

**Prerequisites:** Linear Algebra such as [18.06](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/) and multivariate calculus such as [18.02](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-02-multivariable-calculus-fall-2007/).

Course will involve simple numerical computations using the [Julia language](https://github.com/mitmath/julia-mit).   Ideally install it on your own computer following [these instructions](https://github.com/mitmath/julia-mit#installing-julia-and-ijulia-on-your-own-computer), but as a fallback you can run it in the cloud here:

**Topics:**

Here are some of the planned topics:

* Derivatives as linear operators and linear approximation on arbitrary vector spaces: beyond gradients and Jacobians.
* Derivatives of functions with matrix inputs and/or outputs (e.g. matrix inverses and determinants).  Kronecker products and matrix "vectorization".
* Derivatives of matrix factorizations (e.g. eigenvalues/SVD) and derivatives with constraints (e.g. orthogonal matrices).
* Multidimensional chain rules, and the significance of right-to-left ("forward") vs. left-to-right ("reverse") composition.  Chain rules on computational graphs (e.g. neural networks).
* Forward- and reverse-mode manual and automatic multivariate differentiation.
* Adjoint methods (vJp/pullback rules) for derivatives of solutions of linear, nonlinear, and differential equations.
* Application to nonlinear root-finding and optimization.  Multidimensional Newton and steepest–descent methods.
* Applications in engineering/scientific optimization and machine learning.
* Second derivatives, Hessian matrices, quadratic approximations, and quasi-Newton methods.
